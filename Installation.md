# Guide to Run Battle of Networks 2024 (BoN 2024)

## Prerequisites
- Python Version: The models for BoN 2024 were trained using **Python 3.11.6**. Ensure you have this version installed. You can download it from Python 3.11.6 Download (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/).

## Setting Up a Virtual Environment
To manage dependencies effectively, it's recommended to set up a virtual environment (`venv`). This isolates the project dependencies from your global Python installation. Follow these steps:

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - On Windows open Command Prompt (press `Windows Key + R`, then type `cmd` and press Enter) or a shell environment on Unix systems.
   - Create a new virtual environment by running:
     `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment_name`
     Replace `/path/to/new/virtual/environment_name` with your desired directory path.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - Activate your virtual environment by running:
     `/path/to/new/virtual/environment_name/Scripts/activate` on Windows
    `source /path/to/new/virtual/environment_name/bin/activate` on Mac and Linux.
     Ensure you use the correct path where your virtual environment is located.

3. Install Required Modules:
   - Install all necessary modules by running:
     `pip install -r /code_path/requirements.txt`
     Note: `/code_path/requirements.txt` is the path to the `requirements.txt` file in the BoN 2024 codebase, not in the virtual environment directory.

## Running the Code
After setting up the virtual environment and installing the dependencies, you're ready to run the code. 
Run the `water_futures.py` file or using Jupyter Notebook, select the correct Kernel and run `water_futures.ipynb`.

# GPU Acceleration
BoN 2024 can leverage NVIDIA GPU for enhanced performance. If your system does not have an NVIDIA GPU, modify the configuration in the 'water_futures.xx' file:

Change Line 265 from:
cfg['device'] = 'cuda'
to:
cfg['device'] = 'cpu'

## Note: the Metal acceleration on Mac with M1 or M2 is not working at the time of the submission. Use 'cpu' to ensure a correct running on Apple devices, too. 

# Important Note
The virtual environment for this project includes both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Be aware that this can consume significant storage space.

# Model Run Times

Each models takes the following times during training, if you aim to run the entire project account for long times (more than two days on a single machine). We have 52 iterations during training, 4 in testing and 1 for the final evaluation. All models are run for multiple seeds (for the solution we used n_train_seed=1 and n_test_seed =3 ), but a more appropriate and complete solution should use 5/10 seed.  

The reported times are from a Mac with an 8 core (4+4) Apple silicon M1 processor and 16 GB of RAM. 

Model				Time(s/iteration)
-----------------------------------
LightGBM Simple		|	285
LightGB Robust | 555
Light GBM last week | 283
XGBM | 281
Wavenet				| 3250 (55 min)

All other non deep-learning models take negligible times (less then a minute per iteration).
